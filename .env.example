# .env.example (THIS FILE IS COMMITTED TO GIT)

# Database Credentials
# These are the variables your config.php expects for local development.
# For local development, copy this to a .env file and fill in your XAMPP/local MySQL details.
# When deployed on Railway, these will be provided by Railway's environment variables.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Railway provides MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL (e.g., "containers-us-west-133.railway.app:23306")
# and individual MYSQLHOST, MYSQLPORT, MYSQLUSER, MYSQLPASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE.
# For local XAMPP, you typically set host, user, pass, db name individually.
#
# If your config.php is set up to parse a full URL, you might put a full URL here for local.
# Based on your current config.php, it will fall back to individual host/user/pass/db name
# if MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL isn't a full URL.

# For local development, this would typically be empty or 'localhost' or your local IP if applicable.
# If you configure a local DB with a full URL, you could put that here:
# MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL=mysql://root:@localhost:3306/heritagebank_db
# OR leave it blank if your config.php handles local fallback.
MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL= # This will be set by Railway in production
MYSQL_USER=root # For XAMPP, usually 'root'
MYSQL_PASSWORD= # For XAMPP, often empty string ''
MYSQL_DATABASE=heritagebank_db # Your local database name for HeritageBanking
# Note: MYSQL_HOST and MYSQL_PORT are often derived from MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL or default to localhost:3306 locally.
